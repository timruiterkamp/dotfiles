# dotfiles

Hi there ðŸš€ !

My name is Tim Ruiterkamp and this is my personal .bash_profile and other dotfiles i use during development.


## Contents
In this bash profile there are tweaks to the terminal to make life more easy. It's mostly shortcodes for most used commands i personaly use.

The .gitignore file contains the ability to automatic denied node_modules from being pushed to github. And the .editorconfig has some configuration for a solid editor interface. Look at [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) for more information about the configurations.



## Installation

The .gitignore and .editorconfig can be directly placed inside the root of your working directory.

Installation of a .bash_profile to customize your terminal.
* Start up Terminal.
* Type "cd ~/" to go to your home folder.
* Type "touch .bash_profile" to create your new file.
* Edit .bash_profile with your editor.
* Copy my .bash_profile into your .bash_profile.
* Type ". .bash_profile" in the terminal to reload .bash_profile and update any functions you add.

> **Brew has to be installed on the computer to make Z work.**  
Use ``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ``` to install brew.

To install Z that is used to get directly to certain directories u have visited before, use:

```'brew install z'``` Installs Z.

The first time after u installed Z use cd to change directory. After that u can dismiss long sentences like: usr/test/folder/file and just type z file. The directory will change to usr/test/folder/file.
