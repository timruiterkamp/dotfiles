Installation of a .bash_profile to customize your terminal.
* Start up Terminal.
* Type "cd ~/" to go to your home folder.
* Type "touch .bash_profile" to create your new file.
* Edit .bash_profile with your editor.

> **Brew has to be installed on the computer to make Z work.**  
Use ``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ``` to install brew.

To install Z that is used to get directly to certain directories u have visited before, use:

```'brew install z'``` Installs Z.

The first time after u installed Z use cd to change directory. After that u can dismiss long sentences like: usr/test/folder/file and just type z file. The directory will change to usr/test/folder/file.
